- Shortest Paths

    --Implement a function to store a drawn grid
        starting and enpoint can be set again, without having to redraw the entire grid

    --Implement other algorithms
        -A*

    -- bugs:
        -BFS is supposed to see all non-white fields as obstacles
        
        -when selecting a color, automatically switch to drawing mode
        -when over-coloring the starting or finishing point, set it to null
        -implement actual priority queue for dijkstra and not juts listener
        -enable nodes to show their weight 
        -read over text
        -write paragraph for explanation of the algorithms



    --Implement lineDraw-mode   
        Draw Diagonal Lines 
    
    --Other drawing modes detect of user is holding and let him draw over the canvs this way



-Sorting algorithms

    --Make the interface prettier, which lets a user change the amount of bars to Sorting
        Maybe a slider would be nice:
        0----|--100
        The position of the slider translates to the amounf of bars 
    
    --Maybe give the user a possiblity to enter a set of numbers and sort them with his favourite algorithm


-General

    --Add home to homepage
    --Make interfacees for both algorithm-calsses prettier
        Change button layouts
        Button design
        Colorpallets
    
    --Different Languages: 
        Maybe support an english (default) and a german version, maybe even a spanish one, in order to practice a little bit lol
