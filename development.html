                <h1>A little story about the deveopment of this project</h1>
                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    I wanted to code something like this for very long. I really liked the idea of it; not too difficult to implement, a lot of fun to play around with
                    and maybe even fun for ethnologists.
                </p>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    However, when i saw the first video of some guy on youtube visualizing the algorithms in a very similar fashion, i did not only have no idea about the algorithms used,
                    I also didn't know nuthin about programming something like this.
                </p>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    Of course, i wanted my program, if i ever built something like it, to look nice, otherwise it wouldn't be as much fun - swing was out of question.
                </p>

                <h2>Algorithms 1 - studying computer science</h2>
                
                <p class="whiteText">
                    Then, I started studying computer science. Already in the second semester I heard Algorithms 1 and read the book "Algorithms and data structures" (i think by Niklaus Wirth).
                    I really liked what i learned in this course and started to implement the algorithms i came across in java.
                    At this point the only interaction was thtough the command line.
                </p>

                <h3>Algorithms 1 - my own tutorium</h3>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    Fast forward two semesters and we are in the present. I am holding a Tutorium for Algorithms 1 and having a lot of fun doing it.
                </p>

                    <p class="whiteText">
                        A Tutorium is a class, for students to attend. For algorithms 1, they first hear the lecture about the subject from the professor and then
                        a small group of students (20-30 per Tutorium) come together and i help them understand the subject, as well as giving them excersices, 
                        grading their 'homework'...
                    </p>

                <p class="whiteText">
                    It is in this class, that i revisit all the algorithms, i learned two semesters ago. My understanding of them is now deepend.
                    One day i am preparing a lecture about Heaps. Of course, i wanted to cover Heapsort in this tutorium, as it is only a logical product of buildHeap() and heapify().
                    When visiting the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort" target="_blank">wikipedia web-page of heapsort</a> ,
                    you can see a little <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Sorting_heapsort_anim.gif" target="_blank">animation</a> of it. 
                    Thats what finally triggered the development of this website:

                    This doesn't work because of Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB)

                <h2>The Development </h2>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    I knew i was going to build the project. I also knew i was going to do it in javascript (i had a little experience with it)- also i thought, 
                    if i was finished i could build a little website (this one) around it.

                <h3>Shortest Paths</h3>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    I quickly found what a canvas was and how to draw on it using javascript.
                    Rest was relatively easy;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Draw the squares on the canvas
                    </li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>
                        Add an event listener for a mouse click
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="whiteText">
                    On this note, have fun and explore some algorithms :)
