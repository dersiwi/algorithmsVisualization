- Shortest Paths

    --Implement an interface, such that you can draw any color on the grid
        This color is then the weight of the node, the closer the color to black is, the "heavier" the node is, 
        the more difficult it is to travel through : 
        weight(color) = dist(rgb(color), (0,0,0)) =sqrt(red + green + blue)

    --Implement a function to store a drawn grid
        starting and enpoint can be set again, without having to redraw the entire grid

    --Implement a reset function
        This function should reset the grid, same as reloading the page does
    
    --Implement other algorithms
        -Djikstra
        -DFS
        -A*
        -Bellman Ford (? maybe)

    --Implement a slider (similar to the one described for shortest paths) which lets a user alter the square-size

    --Implement lineDraw-mode


-Sorting algorithms

    --Make the interface prettier, which lets a user change the amount of bars to Sorting
        Maybe a slider would be nice:
        0----|--100
        The position of the slider translates to the amounf of bars 
    
    --Maybe give the user a possiblity to enter a set of numbers and sort them with his favourite algorithm


-General

    --Add home to homepage
    --Make interfacees for both algorithm-calsses prettier
        Change button layouts
        Button design
        Colorpallets
    
    --Different Languages: 
        Maybe support an english (default) and a german version, maybe even a spanish one, in order to practice a little bit lol
